 Starts the QR Transaction Code scanning process, taking as parameter the Account related to said code. This method will add a camera-enabled subview in top of your current view.

Please refer to the @c setCustomQRTransactionViewController method for ways to customize this process.

 Sets a custom QR Transaction View Controller, which will be shown and will display the Transaction Information as soon as the QR code is read and analyzed by the SDK.

This method MUST be called before calling the @c scanQRTransactionCode method for the customization to take effect. Please refer to the integration manual for detailed information about this process.
